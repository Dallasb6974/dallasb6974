# 👋 Hi, I'm Dallas Brown
### Information Systems & Data Analytics | UT Arlington

I specialize in building end-to-end data pipelines that turn fragmented operational data into executive-level strategy. With a background at **Blue Yonder** and **Collins Aerospace**, I bridge the gap between technical SQL engineering and business-facing visualization.
